This programme is a parser that allows you to search for vacancies in two categories ("Аналитика Данных" and "Data Science"). All data on vacancies are taken from the [hh.ru](https://nn.hh.ru/search/vacancy) website. The parser allows you to retrieve information about these vacancies by level. 
All vacancies as a result are divided into 4 groups according to the level of data analysis skills ("Junior", "Middle", "Senior" and "Other", where "Other" means means that all vacancies that did not fall into the previous three groups were placed in this category). For each group, the number of vacancies is counted and general information about each vacancy is given (city, in this case Moscow, metro station, company, etc.). In addition, this parser allows you to vary the number of pages from which information can be taken. All data is saved in tabular csv format.
